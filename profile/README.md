# Multi-Objective Optimization Repository (MOrepo)

This repository is a response to the needs of researchers from the MCDM
society to access multi-objective (MO) optimization instances. The
repository contains instances, results, generators etc. for different MO
problems and is continuously updated. The repository can be used as a
test set for testing new algorithms, validating existing results and for
reproducibility. All researchers within MO optimization are welcome to
contribute.

The repository consists of a main repository
[`MOrepo`](https://github.com/MCDMSociety/MOrepo) at GitHub and a set of
sub-repositories, one for each contribution. Sub-repositories are named
`MOrepo-<name>` where `name` normally is the surname of the first author
and year of the study. All repositories are located within the
[`MCDMSociety`](https://github.com/MCDMSociety/) organization at GitHub.

The main repository contains documentation about how to use and
contribute to `MOrepo`. Moreover, a set of tools are given in the R
package `MOrepoTools` which can be used to retrieve info about test
instance groups, results and problem classes.

Maintainers of `MOrepo` are Lars Relund Nielsen <larsrn@econ.au.dk> and
Sune Gadegaard <sgadegaard@econ.au.dk>.
